## Measuring Copilot's Value
In order to understand the value Copilot is adding to both our developers' workflows and to the business as a whole, we need to first have a baseline from which to compare any new Copilot-enhanced? data to. The easiest question to ask to understand where to take this conversation is: how am I measuring developer impact and satisfaction today? <!-- What metrics do I care about? --> Without data to compare to, demonstrating Copilot's value will be much more challenging.

### Metrics you could track
What defines success for you? Dev Sat/Engagement? Dev speed? Code quality? This will guide the metrics we need to track.
WRT metrics, avoid things that can be gamed like # of lines of code accepted, total # of PRs opened, etc.

Better metrics you could track:
- code quality over time
- bugs resolved per time period time (i.e., MoM)
- PRs merged per iteration (risky, can be gamed)
- Time to merge PR
- code coverage over time
- % of engaged users
- CI Success Rate
- Average PR review time
- Open security alerts
- Total successful build (risky, can be gamed)

Also dev sat surveys.
